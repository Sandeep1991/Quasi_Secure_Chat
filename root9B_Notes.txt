1. server and client program is working.
2. Using gpg I am able to encrypt and generate the gpg encrypted message
3. While sending on the server client I cannot send the exact same thing 
as new line character creates end of message on the server. Solved it by 
writing the file to string function in C.
4. When the message is received the message is a string and gpg will only
decrypt if the message is in exact gpg format file. So, I wrote another 
program string2file.c to convert this into revcheck.txt file.
(!--- The bug is that format is not exact to gpg format )

 ----1 Ask the message to be sent by some shell command
 ----2 Automatically do a gpg encryption 
 ----3 Automatically convert gpg file to a string and send
 
 
 ----1 Receive the message by the invoking the tcpclient by shell
 ----2 Automatically convert gpg string to a gpg txt and then after to gpg
 ----3 Automaticall decrypt the gpg file and echo the message

5. If there is time then try to integrate the two with stunnel.



Steps:
1. Get the gpg package # sudo apt-get install gpg
2. Generate public and private key pair # gpg --gen-key
3. Build tcpserver.c and tcpclient.c 
4. Execute working.sh to run the server
5. Execute revworking.sh to run the client
