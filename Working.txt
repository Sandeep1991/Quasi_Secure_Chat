Working of the Quasi Secure Chat
This application mainly has three parts. First part being the TCP server and client program.
Here the TCP server and client work on localhost IP i.e 127.0.0.1 on port number 5000.
The TCP server is first started and waits for client to connect to it. It can start upto 10
TCP sessions. Then once the TCP client connects to the server the second part of the application starts. 
The user will be asked to input his message to send to the client. The user typed message will again be 
encrypted using RSA encryption provided by GPG. Then the encrypted file will be forwarded over the TCP 
to the client. The TCP client will however decrypt the message using RSA decryption as he has the stream's 
private key. The first time we wish to decrypt the program will ask us for the passphrase to use the private key.
After the decryption the message is displayed in clear text at the client end.
The third part of the program is code hiding which is achieved through Self Modifying Code. 
Since the code we have designed might be subverted it is better to hide the crucial part of the code
within another code which modifies the CPU instruction when executed.
